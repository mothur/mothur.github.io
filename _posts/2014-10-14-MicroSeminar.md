Why didn't I think of that?! In the last few years I've pretty much lost all my
drive to go to conferences to give talks. So when I saw a Twitter post from
[Jennifer Biddle (UDel)](https://www.ceoe.udel.edu/our-people/profiles/jfbiddle)
this summer announcing the creation of the [MicroSeminar](https://microseminar.wordpress.com),
I got excited. After seeing the seminar series roll out over the summer I
noticed they have had a very "environmental" focus to the initial talks. I
offered my services to give a microbiome-based microbial ecology talk and viola!
My talk will be this Friday (10/17/2014) at 11 AM eastern. You can watch it through
their [Google+ site](https://plus.google.com/106615363910557080981/posts)
and later through their [YouTube channel](https://microseminar.wordpress.com/archive-of-past-seminars/).

MicroSeminar is an online seminar series created by Jennifer and
[Cameron Thrash (LSU)](https://thethrashlab.com) who are both awesome Assistant
Professors that also do an effective job utilizing social media to engage
colleagues. The goal of the seminar series is to provide a monthly microbiology
seminar given by a different research group. I think this is great for a couple
reasons. First, many people are in Biology departments with very
little microbiology or are in microbiology departments where there's very little
microbial ecology. So it's great to have a venue to have an hour a month to
learn about the latest and greatest in microbial ecology/environmental
microbiology research. Second, I really hate going to conferences. They're a
time sink, horrible for life/work balance, and very expensive. The cost of going
to ISME in Korea this summer? In the thousands. Cost of sitting with your laptop
watching a seminar? Zilch. Jennifer is correct that this won't kill conferences.
Conferences have a huge social aspect and provide great opportunities for
networking. But the science is frequently stale and pulled from the pages of
last year's *AEM*. I think there's great potential with this model to change how
we disseminate information to our colleagues. Like I said, I think this is big,
deserving of your attention and perhaps others will create parallel online
seminar series that are either more specialized or more general.

When Jennifer took me up on my offer to provide a talk, I was very excited for
the opportunity to give a microbiome talk without the microbiome crap. You will
not see [HMP Girl](https://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/60893000/jpg/_60893806_body.jpg),
no quotes of specious statistics, no mention of obscure disease, and no
venturing into the weeds of bioinformatics. I will be describing ***unpublished***
experiments from the lab where we have taken various sources of microorganisms
and used them to colonize mice that lack their own microbiota. The question is,
how do microbial communities assemble? Is it random? Is it deterministic? These
are big questions in ecology that are difficult to answer in microbial systems
because the little buggers are everywhere and it's hard to start with a clean
slate. But at the same time, they're a great system because they grow so
freaking fast. I look forward to sharing our results and getting people's
feedback on what we've been up to.
